# Pong

My implementation of the game [Pong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong) in Javascript using canvas. It's currently 1 player only (you play against a bot). Move the mouse up and down inside the canvas to move your paddle (the paddle on the left) up and down.

## TODO
- [ ] Make game more customizable
  - [ ] Changeable ball speed
  - [ ] 1 player and 2 player mode
  - [ ] Change bot difficulty
  - [ ] etc.
